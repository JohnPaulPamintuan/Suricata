# Suricata Project: Comprehensive Network Security Monitoring

## Overview
Suricata is a robust open-source network security solution designed to enhance network visibility, detect threats, and provide intrusion detection (IDS) and intrusion prevention (IPS) capabilities. This project demonstrates the deployment, configuration, and utilization of Suricata to improve traffic monitoring and security management. The repository will provide insights into Suricata's features, installation steps, rule creation, and use-case scenarios.

## Project Goals

1. **Understand IDS vs IPS**:
   - Differentiate between Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).
   - Learn how IDS detects and reports threats, while IPS takes automated action against threats.

2. **Install and Configure Suricata**:
   - Successfully install Suricata on a system.
   - Configure necessary rule sets for effective functionality.

3. **Explore Signature and Anomaly-Based Detection**:
   - Leverage custom and built-in rules for threat detection.
   - Understand how Suricata supports various protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP).

4. **Conduct Network Monitoring**:
   - Use Suricata to monitor network traffic.
   - Generate and interpret logs and alerts to identify suspicious activities.

5. **Deploy Suricata in IPS Mode**:
   - Automate threat response actions (e.g., dropping malicious packets).
   - Implement proactive security measures.
